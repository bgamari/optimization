synopsis:      Numerical optimization
description:
  These are a set of implementations of various numerical optimization
  methods in Haskell. Note that these implementations were originally
  written as part of a class project; while at one point they worked
  no attention has been given to numerical stability or the many other
  potential difficulties of implementing robust numerical
  methods. That being said, they should serve to succinctly illustrate
  a number of optimization techniques from the modern optimization
  literature.
  .
  Those seeking a high-level overview of some of these methods are
  referred to Stephen Wright's excellent tutorial from NIPS 2010
  <http://videolectures.net/nips2010_wright_oaml/>. A deeper
  introduction can be found in Boyd and Vandenberghe's *Complex
  Optimization* which available freely online.
