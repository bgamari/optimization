synopsis:      Numerical optimization
description:
  These are a set of implementations of various numerical optimization
  methods in Haskell. Note that these implementations were originally
  written as part of a class project; while at one point they worked
  no attention has been given to numerical stability or the many other
  potential difficulties of implementing robust numerical
  methods. That being said, they should serve to succinctly illustrate
  a number of optimization techniques from the modern optimization
  literature.
  .
  A deep introduction to optimization can be found in Boyd and Vandenberghe's
  *Convex Optimization* which available freely online,
  (<http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/>).
