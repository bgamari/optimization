optimization
===

These are a set of implementations of various numerical optimization
methods in Haskell. Note that these implementations were originally
written as part of a class project; while at one point they worked
no attention has been given to numerical stability or the many other
potential difficulties of implementing robust numerical
methods. That being said, they should serve to succinctly illustrate
a number of optimization techniques from the modern optimization
literature.

Those seeking a high-level overview of some of these methods are
referred to Stephen Wright's excellent
[tutorial](http://videolectures.net/nips2010_wright_oaml/) from NIPS
2010. A deeper introduction can be found in Boyd and Vandenberghe's
*Convex Optimization* which available freely online.
